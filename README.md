# Android Demo App with API List Data

Showing list data using demo API with image and description that demonstrates the use of MVVM Clean Architecture principle, Retrofit for API communication, Coroutines, Kotlin-flow, Jetpack Components, Jetpack Compose, Hilt Dependency Injection, Mockk, Compose Testing and Data Binding for seamless UI updates.

## Features

1. **Clean Architecture:** The App is structured using clean Arch principles, with a clear separation of layers: Presentation, Domain and Data. This promotes scalability, maintainability and testability of the code.
2. **MVVM Architecture:** The app follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, separating concerns between the UI(View), business logic (ViewModel) and data (Model).
3. **Coroutines:** A coroutine is a concurrency design pattern that you can use on Android to simplify code that executes asynchronously.
4. **Retrofit2:** A popular HTTP client for Android, to make API call, this ensures efficient communication with the backend server.
5. **Kotlin flows:** In coroutines, a flow is a type that can emit multiple values sequentially, as opposed to suspend functions that return only a single value.
6. **Jetpack Compose:** Jetpack Compose is Android's recommended modern toolkit for building native UI. It simplifies and accelerates UI development on Android.
7. **Hilt Dependency Injection:** Hilt is a dependency injection library for Android that reduces the boilerplate of doing manual dependency injection in the project.
8. **Mockk:** MockK works great with Android and allows you to mock objects in both your Android unit tests and instrumented tests.
9. **Compose Testing:** UI testing in Jetpack Compose focuses on verifying the behavior and appearance of UI components, ensuring they function as intended.
